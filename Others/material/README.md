# Notes
I have some notes here and some things to remember.

### Install Angular:
1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. open CMD (Admin)
3. ```npm install -g @angular/cli@latest```


### Angular Material Commands I use
```
ng new app3 --routing --style=scss
cd app1
npm install
npm install --save @angular/material @angular/cdk @angular/animations
npm install hammerjs
npm install
ng serve --open
```

### Commands to Remember
- ```ng add @angular/material``` - other way to add Angular Material

### Use Bootstrap (or another css)
- ```npm install --save bootstrap@3```
- update angular.json with .css file at styles
- ```ng serve```

### Commands to Remember
- ```ng generate component servers``` (create a component named servers) **or** ```ng g c servers```
- ```ng new app1 --routing --style=scss``` it creates an app named app1, including routing template and replacing css with scss


### Important Projects - Exercises we finished:
