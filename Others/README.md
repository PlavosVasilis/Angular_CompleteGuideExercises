# Notes
I have some notes here and some things to remember.

### Install Angular:
1. Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. open CMD (Admin)
3. ```npm install -g @angular/cli@latest```


### New Angular App
```
ng new my-app-name
cd my-app-name
ng serve --open
```


### Use Bootstrap (or another css)
- ```npm install --save bootstrap@3```
- update angular.json with .css file at styles
- ```ng serve```

### Commands to Remember
- ```ng generate component servers``` (create a component named servers) or ```ng g c servers```


### Important Projects - Exercises we finished:
- **my-first-app** - you are righting something at a form and you can see it dynamically


### About the Repo
In this repo I will upload many small **Angular Excercises**.
